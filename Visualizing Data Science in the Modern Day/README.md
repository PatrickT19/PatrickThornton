More representative of a data analytics report, this project focuses on showcasing data collection, cleaning, processing, and visualizng techniques in Python. Utilizing data on computer science related publications, this project tells a story about how universities and companies in differnt countries have been expanding their commitment to publishing papers on data science related topics. Digging deeper, we look at what model types and techniques these oragnizations have been focusing on over the past several years. Expanding the focus of the project, we look to the industry of data science has changed over time. This portion of the project uses data from an annual survey Kaggle puts out to professionals in the field. The survey has several reoccuring questions, but requried significant processing to be usable for an analysis. Once processed, the data was used to show how the industry of data science has grown globally over the last half decade, and what sort of skills professionals feel are the most important to be succesful in the field. Both of these topics are displayed visually through the use of several python packages including matplotlib, plotly, altair, geopandas, ipywidgets, and wordcloud.
