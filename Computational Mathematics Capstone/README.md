Companies reliant on seasonal trends such as ice cream shops, cider mills, and bike rental shops are at the mercy of the weather when it comes to their patronage. Using weather conditions gathered from previous years, this project is centered around building a model to predict customer volume on a given day for a bike rental store. To make this prediction two models were created, one being a random forest regressor, and the other a linear regressor. The performance of these models is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), along with three correlation metrics: Pearson, Spearman, and Kendal Tau.
